<h1>Change Platforms</h1>
<p>Using Ripple you can switch between different platforms very easily.</p>
<p>Go to the "platforms" panel box (initially on your left) to do so. Here you can specify your Platform (JIL, Opera or Web)
 as well as the device that runs that platform. You can also switch between portrait and landscape modes given the device supports it.</p>
<p>Go ahead and give it a try, your browser window will refresh itself with the desired platform loaded and it's device emulated.</p>
