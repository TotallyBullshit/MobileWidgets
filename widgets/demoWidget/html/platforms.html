	<h1>Change Platforms</h1>
	<p>Using Ripple you can switch between different platforms very easily.</p>
	<p>Go to the "platforms" panel box (initially on your left) to do so. Here you can specify your Platform (JIL, Opera or Web)
	 as well as the device that runs that platform.</p>
	<p>Go ahead and give it a try, your browser window will refresh itself with the desired platform loaded and it's device emulated.</p>
