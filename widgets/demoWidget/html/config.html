<h1>Widget Configuration Validation</h1>
<p>A feature of Ripple is that is your config file (config.xml for example) is detected, parsed and validated on the fly.
</p>

<p>The Config panel box (initially on the right panel) displays the results of the validation, including whether a node or an attribute passed, failed or is just plain missing.</p>
